## Rules for SimpleEngine
#
# These rules were generated using ChatGPT and the followng prompt
#
# I need you to generate a CSV file for my Hybrid AI Bot FAQ system that follows these requirements:
#
#   Format: The CSV should have message,response columns and use wildcard-based matching (*) for flexible query handling.
#   Source Information: Use the OwlMind framework from GitHub, the assignment document I provided, and our past conversation history to extract relevant FAQs.
#   Broad Matching: Generate multiple variations per question to account for different ways users might phrase their queries.
#   Pre-generated Hybrid Matching: Instead of modifying the bot’s code, apply manual pre-generated variations to simulate fuzzy matching.
#   Compliant with Project Rules: The final CSV must work without requiring any modifications to the bot's source code—it should only update the rules in the CSV.
#   High Priority FAQs: Prioritize the most commonly asked questions from my assignment and project documentation.
#   Output Format: Provide the CSV content here so I can copy and paste it directly into my rules/ directory.
#   Once generated, let me know if there are any gaps or if I should further refine the variations.

*explain the assignment*,"The objective of this assignment is to gain exposure to advanced Generative AI solution design and development by creating a Hybrid AI Bot that balances rule-based and GenAI-based cognition. You must create a first version of the bot (v0.1), add it to the course Discord server, and submit a PDF with screenshots of your running bot on CANVAS. The bot must be implemented using the OwlMind framework without modifying the source code (except for bug fixes). For setup and installation, refer to the GitHub repository: https://github.com/genilab-fau/owlmind."
